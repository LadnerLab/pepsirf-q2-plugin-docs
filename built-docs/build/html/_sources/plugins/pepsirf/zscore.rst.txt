         <pre>Usage: qiime pepsirf zscore [OPTIONS]

     Calculate Z scores for each peptide in each sample with pepsirf's zscore
     module

   Inputs:
     --i-scores ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Normed | RawCounts | NormedDifference |
       NormedDiffRatio]   Name of the file to use as input. Should be a score
                          matrix in the format as output by the demux and subjoin
                          modules. Raw or normalized read counts can be used.
                                                                       [required]
     --i-bins ARTIFACT    Name of the file containing bins, one bin per line, as
       PeptideBins        output by the bin module. Each bin contains a
                          tab-delimited list of peptide names.         [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-trim NUMBER      Percentile of lowest and highest counts within a bin
       Range(0.0, 100.0)  to ignore when calculating the mean and standard
                          deviation.                               [default: 2.5]
     --p-hdi NUMBER       Alternative approach for discarding outliers prior to
       Range(0.0, None)   calculating mean and stdev. If provided, this argument
                          will override --trim, which trims evenly from both
                          sides of the distribution. For --hdi, the user should
                          provide the high density interval to be used for
                          calculation of mean and stdev. For example, '--hdi
                          0.95' would instruct the program to utilize the 95%
                          highest density interval (from each bin) for these
                          calculations.                            [default: 0.0]
     --p-num-threads INTEGER
       Range(1, None)     The number of threads to use for analyses. [default: 2]
     --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT
                          The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                             [default: 'pepsirf']
   Outputs:
     --o-zscore-output ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Zscore]
                          Name for the output Z scores file. This file will be a
                          FeatureTable[Zscore] with the same dimensions as the
                          input score file. Each peptide will be written with its
                          z-score within each sample.                  [required]
     --o-nan-report ARTIFACT
       ZscoreNan          Name of the file to write out information regarding
                          peptides that are given a zscore of 'nan'. This occurs
                          when the mean score of a bin and the score of the focal
                          peptide are both zero. This will be a ZscoreNan file,
                          with three columns per line. The first column will
                          contain the name of the peptide, the second will be the
                          name of the sample, and the third will be the bin
                          number of the probe. This bin number corresponds to the
                          line number in the bins file, within which the probe
                          was found.                                   [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH    Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet  Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                          execution of this action. Or silence output if
                          execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --example-data PATH  Write example data and exit.
     --citations          Show citations and exit.
     --help               Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>pepsirf zscore module

   Calculate Z scores for each peptide in each sample with pepsirf's zscore
   module

   Parameters
   ----------
   scores : FeatureTable[Normed | RawCounts | NormedDifference | NormedDiffRatio]
       Name of the file to use as input. Should be a score matrix in the
       format as output by the demux and subjoin modules. Raw or normalized
       read counts can be used.
   bins : PeptideBins
       Name of the file containing bins, one bin per line, as output by the
       bin module. Each bin contains a tab-delimited list of peptide names.
   trim : Float % Range(0.0, 100.0), optional
       Percentile of lowest and highest counts within a bin to ignore when
       calculating the mean and standard deviation.
   hdi : Float % Range(0.0, None), optional
       Alternative approach for discarding outliers prior to calculating mean
       and stdev. If provided, this argument will override --trim, which trims
       evenly from both sides of the distribution. For --hdi, the user should
       provide the high density interval to be used for calculation of mean
       and stdev. For example, '--hdi 0.95' would instruct the program to
       utilize the 95% highest density interval (from each bin) for these
       calculations.
   num_threads : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       The number of threads to use for analyses.
   pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
       The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

   Returns
   -------
   zscore_output : FeatureTable[Zscore]
       Name for the output Z scores file. This file will be a
       FeatureTable[Zscore] with the same dimensions as the input score file.
       Each peptide will be written with its z-score within each sample.
   nan_report : ZscoreNan
       Name of the file to write out information regarding peptides that are
       given a zscore of 'nan'. This occurs when the mean score of a bin and
       the score of the focal peptide are both zero. This will be a ZscoreNan
       file, with three columns per line. The first column will contain the
       name of the peptide, the second will be the name of the sample, and the
       third will be the bin number of the probe. This bin number corresponds
       to the line number in the bins file, within which the probe was found.</pre>
