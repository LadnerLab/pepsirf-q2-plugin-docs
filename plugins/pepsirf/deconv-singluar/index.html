      <pre>Usage: qiime pepsirf deconv-singluar [OPTIONS]

  converts a list of enriched peptides into a parsimony-based list of likely
  taxa to which the assayed individual has likely been exposed with
  pepsirf's deconv singular mode module

Inputs:
  --i-enriched ARTIFACT  single file containing the names of enriched
    PeptideIDList        peptides, one per line. Each peptide contained in
                         this file (or files) should have a corresponding
                         entry in the '--linked' input file.        [required]
  --i-linked ARTIFACT    Name of linkage map to be used for deconvolution. It
    Link                 should be in the format output by the 'link' module.
                                                                    [required]
  --i-id-name-map ARTIFACT
    PepsirfDMP           Optional file containing mappings from taxonomic id
                         to taxon name. This file should be formatted like the
                         file 'rankedlineage.dmp' from NCBI. It is recommended
                         to either use this file or a subset of this file that
                         contains all of the taxon ids linked to peptides of
                         interest. If included, the output will contain a
                         column denoting the name of the species as well as
                         the id.                                    [optional]
Parameters:
  --p-threshold INTEGER  Minimum score that a taxon must obtain in order to
                         be included in the deconvolution report.   [required]
  --p-scoring-strategy TEXT Choices('summation', 'integer', 'fraction')
                         Scoring strategies 'summation', 'integer', or
                         'fraction' can be specified. By not including this
                         flag, summation scoring will be used by default. The
                         --linked file passed must be of the form created by
                         the link module. This means a file of tab-delimited
                         values, one per line. Each line is of the form
                         peptide_name TAB id:score,id:score, and so on. An
                         error will occurif input is not in this format. For
                         summation scoring, the score assigned to each
                         peptide/ID pair is determined by the ':score' portion
                         of the --linked file. For example, assume a line in
                         the --linked file looks like the following: peptide_1
                         TAB 123:4,543:8 The IDs '123' and '543' will receive
                         scores of 4 and 8 respectively. For integer scoring,
                         each ID receives a score of 1 for every enriched
                         peptide to which it is linked (':score' is ignored).
                         For fractional scoring, the score is assigned to each
                         peptide/ID pair is defined by 1/n for each peptide,
                         where n is the number of IDs to which a peptide is
                         linked. In this method of scoring peptides, a peptide
                         with fewer linked IDs is worth more points..
                                                        [default: 'summation']
  --p-score-filtering / --p-no-score-filtering
                         Include this option if you want filtering to be done
                         by the score of each taxon, rather than the count of
                         linked peptides. If used, any taxon with a score
                         below '--threshold' will be removed from
                         consideration, even if it is the highest scoring
                         taxon. Note that for integer scoring, both score
                         filtering and count filtering (default) are the same.
                         If this flag is not included, then any species whose
                         count falls below '--threshold' will be removed from
                         consideration. Score filtering is best suited for the
                         summation scoring method.            [default: False]
  --p-score-tie-threshold NUMBER
                         Threshold for two species to be evaluated as a tie.
                         Note that this value can be either an integer or a
                         ratio that is in (0,1). When provided as an integer
                         this value dictates the difference in score that is
                         allowed for two taxa to be considered as potentially
                         tied. For example, if this flag is provided with the
                         value 0, then two or more taxa must have the exact
                         same score to be tied. If this flag is provided with
                         the value 4, then the difference between the scores
                         of two taxa must be no greater than 4 to be
                         considered tied. For example, if taxon 1 has a score
                         of 5, and taxon 2 has a score anywhere between the
                         integer values in [1,9], then these species will be
                         considered tied, and their tie will be evaluated as
                         dictated by the specified
                         '--score-overlap-threshold'. If the argument provided
                         to this flag is in (0, 1), then the score for a taxon
                         must be at least this proportion of the score for the
                         highest scoring taxon, to trigger a tie. So if
                         species 1 has the highest score with a score of 9,
                         and species 2 has a score of 5, then this flag must
                         be provided with value >= 4/5 = 0.8 for the species 1
                         and 2 to be considered tied. Note that any values
                         provided to this flag that are in the set { x: x >= 1
                         } - Z, where Z is the set of integers, will result in
                         an error. So 4.45 is not a valid value, but both 4
                         and 0.45 are.                          [default: 0.0]
  --p-score-overlap-threshold NUMBER
                         Once two species have been determined to be tied,
                         according to '--score-tie-threshold', they are then
                         evaluated as a tie. To use integer tie evaluation,
                         where species must share an integer number of
                         peptides, not a ratio of their total peptides,
                         provide this argument with a value in the interval
                         [1, inf). For ratio tie evaluation, which is used
                         when this argument is provided with a value in the
                         interval (0,1), two taxon must reciprocally share at
                         least the specified proportion of peptides to be
                         reported together. For example, suppose species 1
                         shares half (0.5) of its peptides with species 2, but
                         species 2 only shares a tenth (0.1) of its peptides
                         with species 1. These two will only be reported
                         together if score-overlap-threshold' <= 0.1.
                                                                [default: 0.0]
  --p-single-threaded / --p-no-single-threaded
                         By default this module uses two threads. Include
                         this option with no arguments if you only want only
                         one thread to be used.               [default: False]
  --p-outfile TEXT       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to
                         PepSIRF.                    [default: './deconv.out']
  --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT
                         The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                          [default: 'pepsirf']
Outputs:
  --o-deconv-output ARTIFACT
    DeconvSingluar       Name of the file to which output is written. Output
                         will be in the form of a tab-delimited file with a
                         header.                                    [required]
  --o-score-per-round ARTIFACT
    ScorePerRound        Name of directory to write counts/scores to after
                         every round. If included, the counts and scores for
                         all remaining taxa will be recorded after every
                         round. Filenames will be written in the format
                         '$dir/round_x', where x is the round number. The
                         original scores will be written to '$dir/round_0'. A
                         new file will be written to the directory after each
                         subsequent round. If this flag is included and the
                         specified directory exists, the program will exit
                         with an error.                             [required]
Miscellaneous:

  --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                         during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                         execution is successful (silence is golden).

      <pre>pepsirf deconv singular mode module

converts a list of enriched peptides into a parsimony-based list of likely
taxa to which the assayed individual has likely been exposed with pepsirf's
deconv singular mode module

Parameters
----------
enriched : PeptideIDList
    single file containing the names of enriched peptides, one per line.
    Each peptide contained in this file (or files) should have a
    corresponding entry in the '--linked' input file.
threshold : Int
    Minimum score that a taxon must obtain in order to be included in the
    deconvolution report.
linked : Link
    Name of linkage map to be used for deconvolution. It should be in the
    format output by the 'link' module.
scoring_strategy : Str % Choices('summation', 'integer', 'fraction'), optional
    Scoring strategies 'summation', 'integer', or 'fraction' can be
    specified. By not including this flag, summation scoring will be used
    by default. The --linked file passed must be of the form created by the
    link module. This means a file of tab-delimited values, one per line.
    Each line is of the form peptide_name TAB id:score,id:score, and so on.
    An error will occurif input is not in this format. For summation
    scoring, the score assigned to each peptide/ID pair is determined by
    the ':score' portion of the --linked file. For example, assume a line
    in the --linked file looks like the following: peptide_1 TAB
    123:4,543:8 The IDs '123' and '543' will receive scores of 4 and 8
    respectively. For integer scoring, each ID receives a score of 1 for
    every enriched peptide to which it is linked (':score' is ignored). For
    fractional scoring, the score is assigned to each peptide/ID pair is
    defined by 1/n for each peptide, where n is the number of IDs to which
    a peptide is linked. In this method of scoring peptides, a peptide with
    fewer linked IDs is worth more points..
score_filtering : Bool, optional
    Include this option if you want filtering to be done by the score of
    each taxon, rather than the count of linked peptides. If used, any
    taxon with a score below '--threshold' will be removed from
    consideration, even if it is the highest scoring taxon. Note that for
    integer scoring, both score filtering and count filtering (default) are
    the same. If this flag is not included, then any species whose count
    falls below '--threshold' will be removed from consideration. Score
    filtering is best suited for the summation scoring method.
score_tie_threshold : Float, optional
    Threshold for two species to be evaluated as a tie. Note that this
    value can be either an integer or a ratio that is in (0,1). When
    provided as an integer this value dictates the difference in score that
    is allowed for two taxa to be considered as potentially tied. For
    example, if this flag is provided with the value 0, then two or more
    taxa must have the exact same score to be tied. If this flag is
    provided with the value 4, then the difference between the scores of
    two taxa must be no greater than 4 to be considered tied. For example,
    if taxon 1 has a score of 5, and taxon 2 has a score anywhere between
    the integer values in [1,9], then these species will be considered
    tied, and their tie will be evaluated as dictated by the specified '--
    score_overlap_threshold'. If the argument provided to this flag is in
    (0, 1), then the score for a taxon must be at least this proportion of
    the score for the highest scoring taxon, to trigger a tie. So if
    species 1 has the highest score with a score of 9, and species 2 has a
    score of 5, then this flag must be provided with value >= 4/5 = 0.8 for
    the species 1 and 2 to be considered tied. Note that any values
    provided to this flag that are in the set { x: x >= 1 } - Z, where Z is
    the set of integers, will result in an error. So 4.45 is not a valid
    value, but both 4 and 0.45 are.
score_overlap_threshold : Float, optional
    Once two species have been determined to be tied, according to '--
    score_tie_threshold', they are then evaluated as a tie. To use integer
    tie evaluation, where species must share an integer number of peptides,
    not a ratio of their total peptides, provide this argument with a value
    in the interval [1, inf). For ratio tie evaluation, which is used when
    this argument is provided with a value in the interval (0,1), two taxon
    must reciprocally share at least the specified proportion of peptides
    to be reported together. For example, suppose species 1 shares half
    (0.5) of its peptides with species 2, but species 2 only shares a tenth
    (0.1) of its peptides with species 1. These two will only be reported
    together if score_overlap_threshold' <= 0.1.
id_name_map : PepsirfDMP, optional
    Optional file containing mappings from taxonomic id to taxon name. This
    file should be formatted like the file 'rankedlineage.dmp' from NCBI.
    It is recommended to either use this file or a subset of this file that
    contains all of the taxon ids linked to peptides of interest. If
    included, the output will contain a column denoting the name of the
    species as well as the id.
single_threaded : Bool, optional
    By default this module uses two threads. Include this option with no
    arguments if you only want only one thread to be used.
outfile : Str, optional
    The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to PepSIRF.
pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
    The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

Returns
-------
deconv_output : DeconvSingluar
    Name of the file to which output is written. Output will be in the form
    of a tab-delimited file with a header.
score_per_round : ScorePerRound
    Name of directory to write counts/scores to after every round. If
    included, the counts and scores for all remaining taxa will be recorded
    after every round. Filenames will be written in the format
    '$dir/round_x', where x is the round number. The original scores will
    be written to '$dir/round_0'. A new file will be written to the
    directory after each subsequent round. If this flag is included and the
    specified directory exists, the program will exit with an error.</pre>
