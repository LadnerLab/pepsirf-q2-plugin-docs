     Manipulate matrix files with pepsirf's subjoin module

   Inputs:
     --i-multi-file ARTIFACT The name of a tab-delimited file containing score
       MultiFile             matrix and sample name list filename pairs, one per
                             line. Each of these pairs must be a score matrix and
                             a file containing the names of samples (or peptides,
                             if specified) to keep from the input the score
                             matrix. The score matrix should be of the format
                             output by the demux module, with sample names on the
                             columns and peptide names on the rows. The namelist
                             must have one name per line, but can optionally have
                             2, if renaming samples in the subjoin output.
                             Optionally, a name list can be omitted if all
                             samples from the input matrix should be included in
                             the output.                               [optional]
   Parameters:
     --p-input-type VALUE Str % Choices('raw')¹ | Str % Choices('col_sum')² |
       Str % Choices('diff')³ | Str % Choices('diff_ratio')⁴ | Str %
       Choices('ratio')⁵ | Str % Choices('size_factors')⁶
                             Specify the type of file being inputted into
                             subjoin, in order to produce the correct output file
                             format type. raw = FeatureTable[RawCounts], col_sum
                             = FeatureTable[Normed], etc.        [default: 'raw']
     --p-multi-file-input TEXT...
       List[Str]             To use multiple name lists with multiple score
                             matrices, include this argument with a list of file
                             names. Optionally, a name list can be omitted if all
                             samples from the input matrix should be included in
                             the output. Ex:(file1,file1_samples
                             file2,file2_samples) or Ex:(file1 file2 file3).
                                                                       [optional]
     --p-subjoin-input TEXT  Comma-separated filenames (For example:
                             score_matrix.tsv,sample_names.txt ). Each of these
                             pairs must be a score matrix and a file containing
                             the names of samples (or peptides, if specified) to
                             keep in the score matrix. The score matrix should be
                             of the format output by the demux module, with
                             sample names on the columns and peptide names on the
                             rows. The namelist must have one name per line, but
                             can optionally have 2. If 2 tab-delimited names are
                             included on one line, the name in the first column
                             should match the name in the input matrix file,
                             while the name in the second column will be output.
                             Therefore, this allows for the renaming of samples
                             in the output.                            [optional]
     --p-filter-peptide-names / --p-no-filter-peptide-names
                             Flag to include if the name lists input to the
                             input or multi-file options should be treated as
                             peptide (i.e. row) names instead of sample (i.e.
                             column) names. With the inclusion of this flag, the
                             input files will be filtered on peptide names (rows)
                             instead of sample names (column).   [default: False]
     --p-duplicate-evaluation TEXT Choices('include', 'combine', 'ignore')
                             Defines what should be done when sample or peptide
                             names are not unique across files being joined.
                             Currently, three different duplicate evaluation
                             strategies are available: - combine: Combine (with
                             addition) the values associated with identical
                             sample/peptide names from different files. -
                             include: Include each duplicate, adding a suffix to
                             the duplicate name detailing the file from which the
                             sample came. - ignore: Ignore the possibility of
                             duplicates. Behavior is undefined when duplicates
                             are  encountered in this mode Therefore, this mode
                             is not recommended.             [default: 'include']
     --p-outfile TEXT        The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to
                             PepSIRF.                  [default: './subjoin.out']
     --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                             [default: 'pepsirf']
   Outputs:
     --o-subjoin-output ARTIFACT FeatureTable[RawCounts¹ | Normed² |
       NormedDifference³ | NormedDiffRatio⁴ | NormedRatio⁵ | NormedSized⁶]
                             Name for the output score matrix file. The output
                             will be in the form of the input, but with only the
                             specified values (samplenames or peptides) found in
                             the namelists.                            [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                             during execution of this action. Or silence output
                             if execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --example-data PATH     Write example data and exit.
     --citations             Show citations and exit.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>pepsirf subjoin module

   Manipulate matrix files with pepsirf's subjoin module

   Parameters
   ----------
   input_type : Str % Choices('raw')¹ | Str % Choices('col_sum')² | Str % Choices('diff')³ | Str % Choices('diff_ratio')⁴ | Str % Choices('ratio')⁵ | Str % Choices('size_factors')⁶, optional
       Specify the type of file being inputted into subjoin, in order to
       produce the correct output file format type. raw =
       FeatureTable[RawCounts], col_sum = FeatureTable[Normed], etc.
   multi_file_input : List[Str], optional
       To use multiple name lists with multiple score matrices, include this
       argument with a list of file names. Optionally, a name list can be
       omitted if all samples from the input matrix should be included in the
       output. Ex:(file1,file1_samples file2,file2_samples) or Ex:(file1 file2
       file3).
   multi_file : MultiFile, optional
       The name of a tab-delimited file containing score matrix and sample
       name list filename pairs, one per line. Each of these pairs must be a
       score matrix and a file containing the names of samples (or peptides,
       if specified) to keep from the input the score matrix. The score matrix
       should be of the format output by the demux module, with sample names
       on the columns and peptide names on the rows. The namelist must have
       one name per line, but can optionally have 2, if renaming samples in
       the subjoin output. Optionally, a name list can be omitted if all
       samples from the input matrix should be included in the output.
   subjoin_input : Str, optional
        Comma-separated filenames (For example:
       score_matrix.tsv,sample_names.txt ). Each of these pairs must be a
       score matrix and a file containing the names of samples (or peptides,
       if specified) to keep in the score matrix. The score matrix should be
       of the format output by the demux module, with sample names on the
       columns and peptide names on the rows. The namelist must have one name
       per line, but can optionally have 2. If 2 tab-delimited names are
       included on one line, the name in the first column should match the
       name in the input matrix file, while the name in the second column will
       be output. Therefore, this allows for the renaming of samples in the
       output.
   filter_peptide_names : Bool, optional
       Flag to include if the name lists input to the input or multi_file
       options should be treated as peptide (i.e. row) names instead of sample
       (i.e. column) names. With the inclusion of this flag, the input files
       will be filtered on peptide names (rows) instead of sample names
       (column).
   duplicate_evaluation : Str % Choices('include', 'combine', 'ignore'), optional
       Defines what should be done when sample or peptide names are not unique
       across files being joined. Currently, three different duplicate
       evaluation strategies are available: - combine: Combine (with addition)
       the values associated with identical sample/peptide names from
       different files. - include: Include each duplicate, adding a suffix to
       the duplicate name detailing the file from which the sample came. -
       ignore: Ignore the possibility of duplicates. Behavior is undefined
       when duplicates are  encountered in this mode Therefore, this mode is
       not recommended.
   outfile : Str, optional
       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to PepSIRF.
   pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
       The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

   Returns
   -------
   subjoin_output : FeatureTable[RawCounts¹ | Normed² | NormedDifference³ | NormedDiffRatio⁴ | NormedRatio⁵ | NormedSized⁶]
       Name for the output score matrix file. The output will be in the form
       of the input, but with only the specified values (samplenames or
       peptides) found in the namelists.</pre>
