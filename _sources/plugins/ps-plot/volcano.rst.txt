         <pre>Usage: qiime ps-plot volcano [OPTIONS]

     Generates a volcano plot given x and y values. Significant points will be
     highlighted is identifiers are provided.

   Parameters:
     --p-x NUMBERS...        Coordinates along the x-axis at which to plot
       List[Float]           points.                                   [optional]
     --p-y NUMBERS...        Coordinates along the y-axis at which to plot
       List[Float]           points.                                   [optional]

                             not eligible to be highlighted. Please note the taxa

     --p-y-threshold NUMBER  Specifies the maximum p-value a taxa can have in
                             order to be highlighted in the plot. If a taxa's
                             p-value is greater than the provided threshold, then
                             the taxa is not eligible to be highlighted. Please
                             note the taxa must also have an ES greater than the
                             provided ES threshold to also be eligible for
                             highlighting.                        [default: 0.05]
     --p-log / --p-no-log    Specifies whether to or not transform y values. If
                             True, the log (base 10) of the y values will be
                             plotted in ascending order; otherwise, the passed y
                             values will be plotted in descending order.
                                                                  [default: True]
     --p-xy-labels TEXT...   Name of plot's x- and y-axis labels, respectively.
       List[Str]                                            [default: ['x', 'y']]
     --p-titles TEXT...      List of chart titles. These will be used to
       List[Str]             determine the names in the drop down which is used
                             to change chart views.               [default: ['']]

         <pre>Volcano Visualizer

   Generates a volcano plot given x and y values. Significant points will be
   highlighted is identifiers are provided.

   Parameters
   ----------
   x : List[Float], optional
       Coordinates along the x-axis at which to plot points.
   y : List[Float], optional
       Coordinates along the y-axis at which to plot points.
   taxa : List[Str], optional
       List of identifiers, positionally associated with passed p-values and
       enrichment scores. These identifiers will be displayed when the user
       mouses over a point in the chart.
   xy_dir : Str, optional
       Directory containing tab delimited (TSV) files with plotting data.
       Provide this as an alternative if many plots are required.
   xy_access : List[Str], optional
       List with column names in the tables collected in the 'xy_dir' which
       should be used to grab x and y values, respectively. Refer to default
       as an example. Only list length of 2 is supported.
   taxa_access : Str, optional
       Column name in tables collected in the 'xy_dir' which should be used to
       grab highlighting information.
   x_threshold : Float, optional
       Specifies the minimum ES a taxa can have in order to be highlighted in
       the plot. If a taxa's ES is less than the provided threshold, then the
       taxa is not eligible to be highlighted. Please note the taxa must also
       have a p-value less than the provided p-value threshold to also be
       eligible for highlighting.
   y_threshold : Float, optional
       Specifies the maximum p-value a taxa can have in order to be
       highlighted in the plot. If a taxa's p-value is greater than the
       provided threshold, then the taxa is not eligible to be highlighted.
       Please note the taxa must also have an ES greater than the provided ES
       threshold to also be eligible for highlighting.
   log : Bool, optional
       Specifies whether to or not transform y values. If True, the log (base
       10) of the y values will be plotted in ascending order; otherwise, the
       passed y values will be plotted in descending order.
   xy_labels : List[Str], optional
       Name of plot's x- and y-axis labels, respectively.
   titles : List[Str], optional
       List of chart titles. These will be used to determine the names in the
       drop down which is used to change chart views.
