         <pre>Usage: qiime pepsirf link [OPTIONS]

     Defines linkages between taxonomic groups and peptides based on shared
     kmers with pepsirf's link module

   Inputs:
     --i-protein-file ARTIFACT
       ProteinFasta         Name of fasta file containing protein sequences of
                            interest.                                  [required]
     --i-peptide-file ARTIFACT
       PeptideFasta         Name of fasta file containing aa peptides of
                            interest. These will generally be peptides that are
                            contained in a particular assay.           [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-meta TEXT          Optional method for providing taxonomic information
                            for each protein contained in '--protein-file'. Three
                            comma-separated strings should be provided: 1) name
                            of tab-delimited metadata file, 2) header for column
                            containing protein sequence name and 3) header for
                            column containing ID to be used in creatingthe
                            linkage map.                               [required]
     --p-kmer-size INTEGER  Kmer size to use when creating the linkage map.
                                                                       [required]
     --p-kmer-redundancy-control / --p-no-kmer-redundancy-control
                            Optional modification to the way scores are
                            calculated. If this flag is used, then instead of a
                            peptide receiving one point for each kmer it shares
                            with proteins of a given taxonomic group, it receives
                            1 / ( the number of times the kmer appears in the
                            provided peptides ) points.          [default: False]
     --p-outfile TEXT       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to
                            PepSIRF.                      [default: './link.out']
     --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT
                            The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                             [default: 'pepsirf']
   Outputs:
     --o-link-output ARTIFACT
       Link                 Name of the file to which output is written. Output
                            will be in the form of a tab-delimited file with a
                            header. Each entry/row will be of the form:
                            peptide_name TAB id:score,id:score, and so on. By
                            default, 'score' is defined as the number of shared
                            kmers.                                     [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                            during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                            execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --example-data PATH    Write example data and exit.
     --citations            Show citations and exit.
     --help                 Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>pepsirf link module

   Defines linkages between taxonomic groups and peptides based on shared
   kmers with pepsirf's link module

   Parameters
   ----------
   protein_file : ProteinFasta
       Name of fasta file containing protein sequences of interest.
   peptide_file : PeptideFasta
        Name of fasta file containing aa peptides of interest. These will
       generally be peptides that are contained in a particular assay.
   meta : Str
       Optional method for providing taxonomic information for each protein
       contained in '--protein_file'. Three comma-separated strings should be
       provided: 1) name of tab-delimited metadata file, 2) header for column
       containing protein sequence name and 3) header for column containing ID
       to be used in creatingthe linkage map.
   kmer_size : Int
       Kmer size to use when creating the linkage map.
   kmer_redundancy_control : Bool, optional
       Optional modification to the way scores are calculated. If this flag is
       used, then instead of a peptide receiving one point for each kmer it
       shares with proteins of a given taxonomic group, it receives 1 / ( the
       number of times the kmer appears in the provided peptides ) points.
   outfile : Str, optional
       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to PepSIRF.
   pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
       The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

   Returns
   -------
   link_output : Link
       Name of the file to which output is written. Output will be in the form
       of a tab-delimited file with a header. Each entry/row will be of the
       form: peptide_name TAB id:score,id:score, and so on. By default,
       'score' is defined as the number of shared kmers.</pre>
