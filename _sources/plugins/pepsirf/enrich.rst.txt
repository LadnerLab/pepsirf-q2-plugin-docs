                           '--raw_score_constraint' must also be specified.
                                                                       [optional]

     --m-source-column COLUMN  MetadataColumn[Categorical]
                           Metadata file containing all sample names and their
                           source groups. Used to create pairs tsv to run pepsirf
                           enrich module.                              [required]

                           sample to be included in the analysis.This provides a
                           way to impose a minimum read count for a sample to be
                           evaluated.                                  [optional]
     --p-enrichment-failure / --p-no-enrichment-failure
                           For each sample set that does not result in the

                           tab-delimited columns is provided: the first column
                           contains the replicate names (comma-delimited) and the
                           second column provides the reason why the sample did

                           being evaluated, then you may include this flag to
                           stop the filenames from including more than 3
                           samplenames in the output. When this flag is used, the
                           output names will be of the form 'A~B~C~1more', for
                           example.                              [default: False]
     --p-outfile TEXT      The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to
                           PepSIRF.                     [default: './enrich.out']
     --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT
                           The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                             [default: 'pepsirf']

   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH     Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet   Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                           execution of this action. Or silence output if
                           execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --example-data PATH   Write example data and exit.
     --citations           Show citations and exit.
     --help                Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>pepsirf enrich module

   Determines which peptides are enriched in samples with pepsirf's enrich
   module

   Parameters
   ----------
   source : MetadataColumn[Categorical]
       Metadata file containing all sample names and their source groups. Used
       to create pairs tsv to run pepsirf enrich module.
   thresh_file : EnrichThresh, optional
        The name of a tab-delimited file containing one tab-delimited matrix
       filename and threshold(s), one per line. If providing more than z score
       matrix.
   zscores : FeatureTable[Zscore], optional
       FeatureTable containing z scores of the normalized read counts. Fist
       column header must be 'Sequence Name' as produced by pepsirf.
   col_sum : FeatureTable[Normed], optional
       FeatureTable containing the normalized read counts. Fist column header
       must be 'Sequence Name' as produced by pepsirf.
   exact_z_thresh : Str, optional
       Exact z score thresholds.
   exact_cs_thresh : Str, optional
       Exact col-sum threholds.
   raw_scores : FeatureTable[RawCounts], optional
       This matrix must contain the raw counts for each Peptide for every
       sample of interest. If included, '--raw_score_constraint' must also be
       specified.
   raw_constraint : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       The minimum total raw count across all peptides for a sample to be
       included in the analysis.This provides a way to impose a minimum read
       count for a sample to be evaluated.
   enrichment_failure : Bool, optional
       For each sample set that does not result in the generation of an
       enriched peptide file, a row of two tab-delimited columns is provided:
       the first column contains the replicate names (comma-delimited) and the
       second column provides the reason why the sample did not result in an
       enriched peptide file. This file is output to the same directory as the
       enriched peptide files. The 'Reason' column will contain one of the
       following: 'Raw read count threshold' or 'No enriched peptides'.
   truncate : Bool, optional
       By default each filename in the output directory will include every
       replicate name joined by the 'join_on' value. Alternatively, if more
       than two replicates are being evaluated, then you may include this flag
       to stop the filenames from including more than 3 samplenames in the
       output. When this flag is used, the output names will be of the form
       'A~B~C~1more', for example.
   outfile : Str, optional
       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to PepSIRF.
   pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
       The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

   Returns
   -------
   dir_fmt_output : PairwiseEnrichment
       Directory formatted qza containing lists of enriched peptides</pre>
