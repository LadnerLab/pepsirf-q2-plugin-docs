         <pre>Usage: qiime pepsirf bin [OPTIONS]

     Creates groups of peptides with similar starting abundances with pepsirf's
     bin module

   Inputs:
     --i-scores ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Normed¹ | NormedDifference |
       NormedDiffRatio | NormedRatio | NormedSized²]
                           Input tab-delimited normalized score matrix file to
                           use for peptide binning. This matrix should only
                           contain info for the negative control samples that
                           should be used to generate bins (see subjoin module
                           for help generatinig input matrix). Peptides with
                           similar scores, summed across the negative controls,
                           will be binned together.                    [required]
   Parameters:
     --p-allow-other-normalization VALUE Bool % Choices(False)¹ | Bool %
       Choices(True)²                                            [default: False]
     --p-bin-size INTEGER  The minimum number of peptides that a bin must
       Range(1, None)      contain. If a bin would be created with fewer than
                           bin-size peptides, it will be combined with the next
                           bin until at least bin-size peptides are found.
                                                                   [default: 300]
     --p-round-to INTEGER  The 'rounding factor' for the scores parsed from the
       Range(0, None)      score matrix prior to binning. Scores found in the
                           matrix will be rounded to the nearest 1/10^x for a
                           rounding factor x. For example, a rounding factor of 0
                           will result in rounding to the nearest integer, while
                           a rounding factor of 1 will result in rounding to the
                           nearest tenth.                            [default: 0]
     --p-outfile TEXT      The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to
                           PepSIRF.                        [default: './bin.out']
     --p-pepsirf-binary TEXT
                           The binary to call pepsirf on your system.
                                                             [default: 'pepsirf']
   Outputs:
     --o-bin-output ARTIFACT
       PeptideBins¹'²      PeptideBins file that contains one bin per line and
                           each bin will be a tab-delimited list of the names of
                           the peptides in the bin.                    [required]
   Miscellaneous:
     --output-dir PATH     Output unspecified results to a directory
     --verbose / --quiet   Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr during
                           execution of this action. Or silence output if
                           execution is successful (silence is golden).
     --example-data PATH   Write example data and exit.
     --citations           Show citations and exit.
     --help                Show this message and exit.</pre>

         <pre>pepsirf bin module

   Creates groups of peptides with similar starting abundances with pepsirf's
   bin module

   Parameters
   ----------
   scores : FeatureTable[Normed¹ | NormedDifference | NormedDiffRatio | NormedRatio | NormedSized²]
       Input tab-delimited normalized score matrix file to use for peptide
       binning. This matrix should only contain info for the negative control
       samples that should be used to generate bins (see subjoin module for
       help generatinig input matrix). Peptides with similar scores, summed
       across the negative controls, will be binned together.
   allow_other_normalization : Bool % Choices(False)¹ | Bool % Choices(True)², optional
   bin_size : Int % Range(1, None), optional
       The minimum number of peptides that a bin must contain. If a bin would
       be created with fewer than bin_size peptides, it will be combined with
       the next bin until at least bin_size peptides are found.
   round_to : Int % Range(0, None), optional
       The 'rounding factor' for the scores parsed from the score matrix prior
       to binning. Scores found in the matrix will be rounded to the nearest
       1/10^x for a rounding factor x. For example, a rounding factor of 0
       will result in rounding to the nearest integer, while a rounding factor
       of 1 will result in rounding to the nearest tenth.
   outfile : Str, optional
       The outfile that will produce a list of inputs to PepSIRF.
   pepsirf_binary : Str, optional
       The binary to call pepsirf on your system.

   Returns
   -------
   bin_output : PeptideBins¹'²
       PeptideBins file that contains one bin per line and each bin will be a
       tab-delimited list of the names of the peptides in the bin.</pre>
